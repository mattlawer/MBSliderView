MBSliderView
========

MBSliderView is an iOS control that looks like 'Slide to unlock' slider.<br />
It's really easy to implement and fully customizable.<br />
It can be loaded from a nib file (You can use Interface Builder).
The slider thumb is drawn with CoreGraphics so you could change the color as you like.<br />
You also can set the label color :P<br />

Usage
-----

### Use it with Interface Builder : ###

1. Add a MBSliderView variable and the delegate protocol to your controller  :
	
		@interface ViewController : UIViewController <MBSliderViewDelegate>{
			// IBOutlet is just for Interface Builder
			IBOutlet MBSliderView *slider;
		}
	
2. Create an UIView in Interface Builder and change the class to MBSliderView,<br />
	then link it to the IBOutlet you just created at step 1 and the delegate to the controller :

3. Implement the delegate method in the controller :
	
		// MBSliderViewDelegate
		- (void) sliderDidSlide:(MBSliderView *)slideView {
			// Customization example
			// Just do whatever you want
			[slideView setThumbColor:[self randomColor]];
			[slideView setLabelColor:[self randomColor]];
		}


### Use it without Interface Builder : ###

1. Add the delegate protocol to your controller :
	
		@interface ViewController : UIViewController <MBSliderViewDelegate>
	
2. Create the MBSliderView and add it to the conroller view :

		MBSliderView *slider = [[MBSliderView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(20.0, 20.0, self.view.frame.size.width-40.0, 44.0)];
		[slider setText:@"Slide to something"]; // set the label text
		//[s1 setThumbColor:[UIColor blueColor]; // set custom thumb color
		//[s1 setLabelColor:[UIColor yellowColor]]; // set custom label color
		[slider setDelegate:self]; // set the MBSliderView delegate
		[self.view addSubview:slider];
		[slider release];
    
3. Implement the delegate method in the controller :
	
		// MBSliderViewDelegate
		- (void) sliderDidSlide:(MBSliderView *)slideView {
			// Customization example
			// Just do whatever you want
			[slideView setThumbColor:[self randomColor]];
			[slideView setLabelColor:[self randomColor]];
		}
